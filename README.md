# D&amp;D 5e Character Builder (SRD Data Only)

A step-by-step web app to create a character for a D&D 5e character. Starting very simple and limited, can expand over time.
Currently testing with pulling from [dnd5eapi](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/)

The live version can be found [here](https://fathomless-bastion-99529.herokuapp.com/), though unfortunately, you currently need to allow mixed/unsafe scripts (because of the API I'm currently using)
