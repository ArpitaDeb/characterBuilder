Desired features for the future:

Randomizer - makes selections randomly for super-quick character generation
     -Most likely, I will actually make this feature pull from the library of already-made characters. That way, the "random" character you wind up with has had some thought put into them, still

All SDK Content
     -In the interest of time, I had to narrow the available options even more than the SDK narrows them. I would like to add in all the SDK content to allow for more choices
      
PDF Export
     -Exporting your character to a printable character sheet (whether official sheet or something else)
     
Save, Load, Edit, Finish-Later Options
     -Saving all of the characters you made and editing them later (or finishing them later) is a feature that would require a user database, complete with logins, etc.

Interactive Web-Based Character Sheet
     -This would be way down the line as a very different branch, but eventually being able to use a digital version of your character sheet to track your character while playing would be nice (track damage, status, inventory, etc.)
